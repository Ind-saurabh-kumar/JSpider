                <li> <b>NoSQL Database:</b> MongoDB is a NoSQL database, meaning it uses a non-relational data model. It stores data in JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas, making it flexible and adaptable for various data types and structures.
                <li><b>Document-Oriented:</b> Data is stored in BSON (Binary JSON) documents, which can contain nested data structures. Each document can vary in structure, unlike tables in relational databases where rows must have a consistent structure.</li>
                <li><b>Scalability:</b> MongoDB is designed to scale out horizontally across multiple servers. It supports sharding, which distributes data across different machines to handle large amounts of data and high throughput.</li>
                <li> <b>High Availability:</b> MongoDB provides replication, where data is mirrored across multiple servers (replica sets). This ensures high availability and fault tolerance, allowing automatic failover in case of server failures.</li>

                <li><b>Web Framework for Node.js:</b> Express.js is a minimalist web application framework for Node.js. It provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications.</li>
                <li><b>Middleware:</b> Express.js uses middleware functions to handle requests. Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. This allows for modular and reusable code.</li>
                <li><b>Routing:</b> Express.js provides a routing mechanism to define application endpoints (URLs) and how they respond to client requests. Routing methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE are used to handle HTTP methods.</li>
                <li><b>Template Engines:</b> Express.js supports various template engines like Pug (formerly Jade), EJS, Handlebars, etc., for generating dynamic HTML pages on the server-side.</li>

                <li><b>JavaScript Library:</b> React.js is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications where data can change over time.</li>
                <li><b>Component-Based:</b> React.js is based on the concept of reusable components. Components are independent, isolated pieces of code that represent a part of the user interface. They can be composed together to build complex UIs.</li>
                <li><b>Virtual DOM:</b> React.js uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) for efficient rendering of UI components. The virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM, and React compares the virtual DOM with the actual DOM to determine the minimal set of DOM operations needed to update the UI efficiently.</li>
                <li><b>Declarative:</b> React.js promotes a declarative style of programming, where developers describe what should be rendered and React takes care of updating the DOM to match the desired state. This contrasts with imperative programming, where developers have to manually manage DOM updates.</li>

                <li><b>JavaScript Runtime:</b> Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server-side.</li>
                <li><b>Asynchronous and Event-Driven:</b> Node.js uses a non-blocking, event-driven I/O model, which makes it lightweight and efficient for handling concurrent connections and I/O-intensive operations.</li>
                <li><b>Single-Threaded, Non-blocking:</b> Node.js operates on a single-threaded event loop, meaning it can handle multiple requests simultaneously without creating a new thread for each request. This architecture is particularly suitable for applications requiring high scalability and real-time interactions.</li>
                <li><b>NPM (Node Package Manager):</b> Node.js comes with NPM, a package manager that hosts thousands of libraries and tools for Node.js development. NPM allows developers to easily integrate third-party modules into their applications.</li>
